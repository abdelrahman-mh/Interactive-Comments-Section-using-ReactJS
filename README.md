## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - CSS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

This is my second attempt in making a ReactJS project and I've actually done this same project before using Vanilla JS and CSS. Recreating the same project using a JS Framework was difficult but I did learn a lot when it comes to using React hooks like useContext as well as state management. I've also used Moment.js for dynamic timestamps and localStorage to save the comments in the browser.
